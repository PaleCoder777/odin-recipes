        <p>
            The peanut butter and jelly sandwich is a simple staple in many households.
            It mixes the grainy texture of peanut butter with the sweetness of jelly
            to create a combo that can't be beat.

            It uses so little ingredients,
            while being quick to make, and can even be eaten on the go.
